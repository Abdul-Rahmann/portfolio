# Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is a personal portfolio website created to showcase projects, technical skills, and accomplishments. The site will act as a digital resume and provide recruiters, collaborators, and potential clients an overview of my expertise. The project will be built in incremental stages, allowing room for gradual development and polishing.

## Project Objective
- **Create** a responsive and visually appealing portfolio website
- **Showcase** completed projects, technical skills, and accomplishments
- **Provide** ways for visitors to contact or connect via email or social platforms
- **Host** the website on GitHub Pages for free and wide accessibility

## Development Stages and Plan
To ensure progress, we are breaking the project into multiple incremental stages, starting from basic scaffolding to advanced features.

### Stage 1: Scaffold and Initial Setup
**Objective:** Create the foundation of the project and get it hosted live on GitHub Pages.

- [ ] Create a GitHub repository for the project
- [ ] Set up the initial folder structure:
  ```
  /index.html           # Main HTML file
  /css/                 # Folder for stylesheets
  /js/                  # Folder for JavaScript scripts
  /assets/              # Folder for images, fonts, etc.
  README.md             # Documentation for the project
  ```
- [ ] Add a placeholder landing page (`index.html`) with a simple welcome message
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings to host the site at `https://<username>.github.io`

### Stage 2: Basic Content Structure
**Objective:** Add the core structure for all sections of the website.

**About Me Section:**
- [ ] Add a short bio including role and key interests
- [ ] Include a link to download a resume (PDF)

**Projects Section:**
- [ ] Add placeholder project cards with basic details like project title, description, and links

**Skills Section:**
- [ ] Add a list of technical skills/tools
- [ ] Include icons for better visual appeal (optional)

**Contact Section:**
- [ ] Link to social platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub)
- [ ] Add a placeholder for a contact form (to be implemented later)

### Stage 3: Styling and Responsiveness
**Objective:** Improve the website's design, responsiveness, and user experience.

- [ ] Design a clean and modern theme, using:
  - [ ] Custom **CSS3** styles OR
  - [ ] Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS framework (optional)
- [ ] Ensure responsiveness for mobile and tablet devices
- [ ] Add a navigation bar with links to all sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- [ ] Create a footer with contact/social links and copyright information

### Stage 4: Projects and Enhancements
**Objective:** Finalize the Projects section and add any advanced enhancements.

**Projects Section:**
- [ ] Populate actual project data with detailed descriptions
- [ ] Add screenshots and links to repositories or demos for each project
- [ ] Implement **modals** or a dynamic UI to display project details

**Enhancements:**
- [ ] Add **dark mode support** with a toggle button
- [ ] Introduce animations for smooth transitions (use libraries like AOS, GSAP as needed)

### Stage 5: Advanced Features
**Objective:** Add interactivity and finalize optional advanced features.

- [ ] Complete the **contact form**:
  - Validate inputs (name, email, message)
  - Optionally use a form submission handler (e.g., Formspree, Google Forms)
- [ ] Add analytics to track visitor behavior (e.g., Google Analytics)
- [ ] Optimize the site for SEO (meta tags, alt-text for images, and sitemaps)

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure/content of the website
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity (e.g., contact forms, dark mode toggle)
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for the website
- (Optional) **Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS**: CSS frameworks for faster styling

## Live Demo
Once deployed, the live website will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io`
